# PythonFun

A repository where i will put python examples, snippets which i found interesting, or tried just for fun read.

1. Decorators vs Closures -> The major difference b/w decorator and closure that i noticed is closure may accept number or anything as parameter, but decorator always accepts a function and returns a function itself.
